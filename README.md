## Weathered

Welcome to Weathered! My first React-based Weather App!

# Introduction
Weathered is a simple React application that takes in a city and it returns the current + forecasted weather and conditions! From highest temp to chance of rain, this weather app has it all. Using a basic server to host the results from the easy to use API, WeatherAPI, I projected the results in an easy to read format on any device!

# Development

As I am currently still learning how to manipulate React with a backend server, connecting the two sections was a bit intense. Utliizing a static server, I was able to load my Javascript on a singular page with one command. 
For the frontend, I used React, with simple state variables and slightly more complex Javascript, I was able to organize all of my code onto the page as you see above! The backend is s simple server that hosts a "forecast" page, which posts whatever JSON information is returned from the WeatherAPI. This is when the main component sends a get request amd retrieves said information from the "forecast" page, and applies it to the page!
